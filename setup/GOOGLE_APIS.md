# Google APIs Setup

To interface with Google APIs, the app will need access to a local "service account" credentials file.

## Service Account Credentials

From the [Google API Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page, create a new service account as necessary.

For the chosen service account, create new JSON credentials file as necessary from the "Keys" menu, then download the resulting JSON file into the root directory of this repo, specifically named "google-credentials.json".
